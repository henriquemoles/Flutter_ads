## Introduction

Monetizing mobile applications is a common goal for app developers, and one popular method is integrating ads. Google Ads is a widely-used advertising platform that offers various ad formats and monetization options. This Flutter project showcases how to integrate Google Ads into your app, allowing you to generate revenue from your app's user base.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with this Flutter Google Ads integration project:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-google-ads-integration.git
   ```

2. **Flutter Setup**

   Make sure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your system. If not, you can [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) by following the official documentation.

3. **Dependencies**

   Run the following command in the project root directory to install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Configuration

Before using Google Ads in your Flutter application, you need to set up the necessary configuration:

1. **Google AdMob Account**

   If you don't have an AdMob account, [create one](https://apps.admob.com).

2. **Ad Unit ID**

   Obtain an Ad Unit ID from your AdMob account for the type of ads you want to display (e.g., banner ads, interstitial ads, rewarded ads).

3. **Configure AdMob in the App**

   Configure AdMob by adding your Ad Unit IDs and initializing the AdMob SDK. You can do this in the `main.dart` or any relevant file in your Flutter project.

   ```dart
   import 'package:firebase_admob/firebase_admob.dart';

   void main() {
     WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
     FirebaseAdMob.instance.initialize(appId: 'YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID');
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

   Replace `'YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID'` with your AdMob App ID.

4. **Implement Ad Widgets**

   Implement the specific ad widgets you want to display (e.g., `BannerAd`, `InterstitialAd`, `RewardedAd`) in your Flutter app's relevant screens or pages.

## Usage

This Flutter project provides examples and templates for integrating various types of Google Ads into your application. You can find detailed implementation details in the `lib` directory.

1. **Banner Ads**

   ![Banner Ad Example](/screenshots/banner_ad_example.png)

   Implement banner ads in your app using the `BannerAd` widget.

2. **Interstitial Ads**

   Implement interstitial ads to display full-screen ads at strategic points in your app's flow.

3. **Rewarded Ads**

   Implement rewarded ads to offer users incentives for viewing ads, such as in-app currency or premium content access.

Refer to the source code and documentation within the project for more detailed usage instructions for each ad type.
